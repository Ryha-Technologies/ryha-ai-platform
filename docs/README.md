## 📊 PRD Golden Rules

This PRD answers five critical questions:

1. **Why are we building this?**  
   → Traditional pentesting is slow, expensive, and not continuous. Organizations need 24/7 AI-driven security.

2. **Who is it for?**  
   → Enterprises (Netflix, banks), mid-size companies (SaaS, FinTech), startups, and cybersecurity teams.

3. **What exactly will it do?**  
   → Autonomous penetration testing using 25 AI agents, covering web apps, APIs, code, and infrastructure—all safe and compliant.

4. **What does success look like?**  
   → 10x faster pentesting, 90% cost reduction, continuous monitoring, zero human errors, professional reports.

5. **What are the limits?**  
   → SAFE-ONLY operations: no exploitation, no brute-force, no DDoS, strictly within authorized scope.
