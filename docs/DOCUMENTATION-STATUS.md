# Ryha AI PRD - Documentation Structure

## 📁 Files Created

I've created the foundation of your comprehensive PRD documentation with the following structure:

### ✅ Core Documents (Created)

1. **README.md** - Master index with complete navigation
2. **01-executive-summary.md** - Vision, mission, value proposition, workflow
3. **02-product-overview.md** - Platform capabilities, pentesting modes, scope
4. **03-problem-solution.md** - Market problems, solution architecture, ROI

## 📝 Next Steps

### Option 1: Create All Remaining Files
I can continue creating all the remaining MD files following the same structure and quality as the ones already created.

### Option 2: Create Specific Sections
Let me know which sections you need most urgently, and I'll prioritize those.

### Option 3: Modify Existing Files
If you want changes to the files already created, I can refine them further.
